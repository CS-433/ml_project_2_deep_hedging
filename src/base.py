    Constructs an abstract based class Algorithm.
    This will be the main bone of all Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
    This class gives a clear structure of what needs to be implemented for all reinforcement algorithm in general.
    If there is other extra methods to be specified, child class will inherit the existing methods as well as
    add new methods to it.
